Welcome to funflow's documentation!
===================================

**Funflow** is a python library to create complex pipelines easily!

This Python library empowers developers to effortlessly design and manage complex data pipelines.
Inspired by the dataflow programming paradigm, it transforms the way you build workflows by organizing them into pipelines ``Model`` composed of nodes ``Layer``, each transforming inputs into outputs.
At the heart of this library is its flexible templating system for input management, which does away with the limitations of rigid, fixed input names and gives you unprecedented flexibility and control.
Whether you're orchestrating simple tasks or architecting large-scale systems, this tool takes the complexity out of pipelines, letting you focus on what really matters - delivering results!
